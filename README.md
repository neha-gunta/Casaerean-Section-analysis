This study aims to examine the prevalence and trends of C-section deliveries in India using the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) datasets. The data was cleaned and preprocessed using techniques such as sampling, normalization. The highest prevalence of C-section deliveries was found in urban areas (32.9%), followed by rural areas (14.9%). Data Analysis techniques like Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes were used and the features highly affecting C-section were identified. Further research is needed to understand the factors contributing to the increasing trend of C-section deliveries in India and to identify appropriate interventions to reduce unnecessary C-sections
